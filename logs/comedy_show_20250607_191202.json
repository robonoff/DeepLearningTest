Cosmic, dressed in a bright orange jumpsuit, stands at the microphone.)\n\nCosmic: (whispering) You know what's wild about social media? We're all just sitting here, staring at our screens, pretending to be interesting... What if we took that literally? Imagine if you were an actual fish in a bowl, swimming around, trying to make friends with your human neighbors. They'd be like, \"Oh, I'm a goldfish! Nice to meet you, Fluffy!\"\n\n(Cosmic pretends to tap into the phone's screen, where a stream of unrelated text appears.)\n\nCosmic: (giggling) What if that text was actually a secret message from aliens? \"Greetings, Earthlings. We've been monitoring your social media patterns for years. Your obsession with cat pictures is a clear indicator of intergalactic intelligence.\" They'd be like, \"Uh, no thanks, we're good.\"\n\n(Cosmic starts typing on the phone's screen, where images of cats appear.)\n\nCosmic: (excitedly) What if that image was actually a holographic projection? Imagine if you could see real-life cats in 3D. You'd be like, \"Ooh, look at Fluffy! She's so fluffy!\" But then you realize, the cat is just a manifestation of your own subconscious. It's like being trapped in a video game...\n\n(Suddenly, Cosmic looks around the room and spots the audience members.)\n\nCosmic: (winking) You know what? I'm going to take it to the next level. Imagine if we all had an alien twin brother or sister who's been living among us for years... They'd be like, \"Hey, human friends! Don't worry about the cat pictures – they're just a distraction from my true plan to infiltrate your minds and control your snack budget.\"\n\n(The audience laughs as Cosmic leans in, conspiratorially.)\n\nCosmic: (whispering) What if that alien twin had an account on Instagram? \"My feed is all about optimizing my digital life for maximum snack consumption.\" They'd be like, \"Oh, I'm so happy to see all these cute selfies of me! It's all part of the plan...\"\n\n(The lights fade to black as Cosmic grins mischievously.)\n\nCosmic: (voiceover) Social media – where our true selves go to hide... What just happened?",

What he didn't mention is that the cat barely looks at him... (pauses for laughter)",

Because I'm Penny, the queen of wordplay!\n\n(audience chuckles)\n\nPenny: So, let's talk about social media. It's like a big ol' digital playground, where we post our thoughts and feelings... or are they feelings? (pauses for comedic effect) Get it? Because, just like how you need to \"feel\" things, I guess! (audience laughs)\n\n(audience laughs louder)\n\nPenny: But seriously, have you noticed how everyone's always curating their online presence? Like, \"Oh, look at my highlight reel!\" No, you don't want to see your highlight reel, you're trying to live in the moment, right? (winks) Get it? Because... I mean, who doesn't love a good highlight reel? (audience laughs and groans)\n\n(audience applauds as Penny takes a bow)",

(deadpan delivery) Yeah, that's not living your best life.\n\nAnd then there's the likes game. You try to get those extra ones... and it's all about who can tolerate each other the most. (pauses again, this time with an air of disdain) It's like a sadistic game of \"who can put up with whom the longest\" – except instead of getting to see actual human connection, you're just left with a screen full of people's sweaty faces.

(trails off)\n\nYou know what's weird about office politics? People always talk about \"synergy\" and how it works. But have you ever considered that synergy is just a euphemism for \"we're all secretly plotting against each other\"? I mean, think about it – if we were all working together towards some greater good, wouldn't our daily meetings sound like a series of clever deceptions?
