But honestly, I just want to know if Siri still has my voicemails from 2015.\n\nAnd have you tried to set up two-factor authentication on any of those websites lately? It's like they're trying to prove a point: \"Your password? Yeah, no thanks â€“ we believe in your integrity... to be wrong.\" (audience chuckles)\n\nNow it's time for our next comedian, Rachel Riley from Brooklyn. She's got a great set about navigating dating apps and technology addiction. Welcome back! Is anyone here as confused as they are by the whole 'password management' thing?",

A moo-sical band, because they're always udderly passionate about being in tune! Get it?\n\nAnd have you ever wondered, why do cats always land on their feet? It's purr-fectly logical... because gravity is cat-atonic and can't figure out what to make of a furry little ball like that!\n\n(laughs) Ah, okay, maybe those weren't exactly cat-astrophic... (giggles)\n\nNext up, I'd love to know: whoever comes on after me had better bring the paws-itive vibes, because our top comedian is going to ROAR with laughter!",

So, I've been thinking... have you ever noticed that when life gives you lemons, it's actually just trying to tell you that you have a lemon tree on your front lawn and you need to mow the grass? (pauses for comedic effect)\n\nBut seriously, if your relationship ends in a divorce, you might get to keep the Netflix password... unless you're 35 and still living with your parents, like me. Then, it's just you against the cord-cutting bills. (chuckles from the audience)\n\nOn to our next comedian! Please welcome, everyone, Sarah Knighton with her brand of biting sarcasm and general disdain for human existence! (raises an eyebrow)",

Imagine walking down a forest path, and suddenly, you're face-to-face with a cranky tree branch that's judging your life choices. \"You went that direction at the fork in the road? Amateur.\" The wind is whispering all sorts of insults to its friends up there... (audience chuckles) This could explain why nobody ever takes pictures with them; they just don't want to capture their tantrums.\n\n( gesturing to an imaginary crowd) You guys have any experience with a paperclip having an existential crisis?\n\nAnd, now that we've explored the emotional lives of paperclips... (pausing for dramatic effect) Next up, we have the comedian who's going to tell us what he really thinks about coffee; (winking at the audience) if you'll excuse me... \"What's your poison?\"",

'You think flushing me makes you feel clean? Ha! I'm storing all your deepest, darkest hopes and fears in my porcelain throne!'

(chuckles from the audience)\n\nSo, let's get this feeling party started for inanimate objects! If a chair had feelings, what would be its complaints? \"You sit on me all day, every day... I'm always getting screwed in life!\" (audience laughs) Ah, see what I did there with...screwed? (winks)\n\nAnd if a couch were having an existential crisis? \"I just feel like I'm always being sat upon... but nobody ever sits on my problems! It's like, I have feelings too, you know. Don't just use me as a soft landing!\" (audience laughs louder) Get it? Soft landing? (giggles)\n\nAlright, alright, I know what you're thinking: \"Penny, this is all just furniture-mentally unstable comedy.\" But hey, don't leave just yet! Our next comedian, the infamous Dave Davis, is ready to... hammer home some laughs. Or should I say... nail it? (laughter from the audience)",

Was it just a screw loose?\" (delivering punchline with deadpan expression) And don't even get me started on the therapist's copay â€“ that's gonna be a real nail-biter. (pauses again for comedic effect)\n\nBut seriously, what if your toaster got divorced from you? \"You're just too crumby for my tastes.\" (dramatic pause) Now that's a relationship ender... Too dark? Good.\n\n(setting up the next turn)\nWe've all been to relationships that ended badly. Has anyone here ever been in an affair with their blender? (eyebrow raised, inviting audience participation)",

Well, let me ask you... what if your IKEA bookshelf has had enough of holding your textbooks and decides to break free from its Swedish shackles just so it can become a sentient therapist on Netflix? Imagine binge-watching your problems, 'because we all need someone rational to sort out our lives'... and that's where my Book Shelf-terapist comes in â€“ Book-slated for success! ( audience chuckles )\n\nBut, what if the TV behind your couch starts judging you for your eating habits? Not just \"turn it off,\" but a full-fledged intervention where it just displays an endless loop of 'Diet Videos' and silently screams \"Fries-ally Yours\" whenever you open the fridge. It's like having a screen-savvy guilt trip that says, \"YOU KNOW WHAT YOU CAN CUT DOWN ON? YOUR MOUTH!\" (laughter)",
